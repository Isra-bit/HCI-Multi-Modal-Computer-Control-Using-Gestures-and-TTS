User ManualHand Gesture-Based Keyboard
Thank you for choosing our hand gesture-based keyboard. This user manual will guide you on how to effectively use the keyboard through hand gestures and movements.

1. Hand Gesture and Positioning:
Position your hand in a "victory" gesture, where your palm faces inward and your fingers are slightly spread apart.
Ensure that your hand is within the camera's field of view and clearly visible.

2. Cursor Movement:
Move your hand on the screen to control the cursor's position.
As you move your hand, the cursor will correspondingly move on the screen.
Experiment with different hand movements and find a comfortable and efficient technique for cursor navigation.

3. Clicking a Letter on the Keyboard:
To click a letter on the virtual keyboard, perform the following gesture:
Hover your hand over the desired letter on the virtual keyboard.
Bring your index finger and middle finger together, mimicking a scissor motion.
Perform the scissor gesture in proximity to the letter to register as a click action.
Practice the gesture to become comfortable and proficient in clicking letters accurately.

4. Typing and Entering Text:
Use the cursor movement and clicking gestures to navigate and enter text as you would with a physical keyboard.
Position your hand over each letter and perform the scissor gesture to input the corresponding characters.
Familiarize yourself with the keyboard layout and practice the clicking gesture for efficient typing.

Virtual Mouse:
Eye based Mouse
A virtual mouse using eye recognition, also known as eye-gaze or eye-tracking technology, is a system that allows users to control a computer cursor or navigate through a virtual environment using their eye movements. Instead of using a physical mouse or other input devices, the system tracks the movements of the user's eyes and translates them into corresponding actions on the screen.

User Manual Eye-Based Mouse
Thank you for choosing our eye-based mouse. This user manual will guide you on how to effectively use the mouse through eye movements and blinking for clicking actions.

1. Face Placement and Camera Positioning:
Position yourself comfortably in front of the camera, ensuring that your face is adequately framed.
Adjust the camera position, if necessary, to achieve the best tracking results for your eyes and eye movements.

2. Left Click:
To perform a left-click action, blink your left eye once.
Ensure that your blink is deliberate and distinct to register as a left click.
Practice blinking with your left eye to become comfortable and proficient in executing left-click actions accurately.

3. Cursor Movement:
Move your eyes and focus on different areas of the screen to control the cursor.
The right eye's movements will be tracked to determine the cursor's position.
Experiment with different eye movements and find a comfortable and efficient technique for cursor navigation.

4. Face and Eye Placement:
Ensure that your face remains within the designated frame area in front of the camera.
Position your eyes adequately in the frame, allowing for accurate eye tracking and movement detection.
Adjust your position as necessary to maintain consistent tracking and optimal performance.
